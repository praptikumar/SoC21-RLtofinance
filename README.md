# Initial Learnings
The initial phase of the project was mainly learning based and involved learning in deep about reinforcement learning.


The initial learning experience included:


- Learnt about Neural Networks through academics during the initial period.   
- Completed the 4 lecture videos of RL course by David Silver    
- Reading about RL algorithms from this blog- https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/
-

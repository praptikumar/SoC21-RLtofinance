# Initial Learnings
The initial phase of the project was mainly learning based and involved learning in deep about reinforcement learning.


The initial learning experience included:


- Learnt about Neural Networks through academics during the initial period.   
- Completed the 4 lecture videos of RL course by David Silver    
- Reading about RL, kinds of algorithms and lots more from this blog- https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/


This gave me a working understanding of how RL works.

# Further Progress
Going further down the timeline, I started learning more on RL through :
- Q Learning- through this video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMk_XtIEzH8&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7
- SUDARSHAN RAVICHANDRAN - HANDS-ON REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH PYTHON book
- Also tried and worked on these tutorials:

https://towardsdatascience.com/trade-smarter-w-reinforcement-learning-a5e91163f315   
https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-stock-trading-agents-using-matplotlib-and-gym-584c992bc6d4  
but couldn't complete so as tensortrade is not working anymore, so faced a lot of issues with the same.
